Getting Started
=================

MassiveNet comes with an example project designed to introduce you to the basics of using the library. There are three separate scenes nested under the Massive > Examples folder. You'll find Client, Lobby, and Server folders, each containing their own scripts and scenes. 

The main scripts to pay attention to are the ClientModel, ServerModel, and LobbyModel scripts. They are responsible for NetSocket configuration and startup as well as basic logic for handling connections. 

You'll also want to take a look a the scripts responsible for position synchronization, which are NetController and SyncPosition in the Client > Scripts folder, and the PlayerCreator and AiCreator scripts in the Servers > Scripts folder.
