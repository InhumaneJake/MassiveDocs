Views
=====================

In MassiveNet, like in Unity Networking, a NetView is representative of a communication channel reserved for a network object. A NetView provides a unique network identifier, concept of ownership, and facilities for synchronizing the state of the object. A NetView component must be attached to each object which has a state that must be synchronized.
